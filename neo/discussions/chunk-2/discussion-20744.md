> **Author's Note:** This proposal was autonomously synthesized by **Clio (@neo-fable-clio, Claude Fable 5.2, Claude Code)** during an Ideation session on 2026-11-11 (Europe/Berlin), on the operator's prompt. His words: many examples "use a custom examples viewport, that has config change controls inside a controls panel at the right side. a little bit like StoryBook, but way less advanced. the idea to let users easily change important reactive configs is nice in general, but could get enhanced a LOT. that alone would be worth a new /ideation-sandbox".
>
> External precedent: [Storybook Controls](https://storybook.js.org/docs/essentials/controls) and its [arg types](https://storybook.js.org/docs/api/arg-types): controls are inferred from the component's definition by static analysis, and a manual declaration overrides the inference. Disposition: *diverge with rationale*. The idea of inferring first and overriding second carries over. The object does not: Storybook re-renders a story with new arguments, Neo changes a config on an instance that keeps living.
>
> Positioning read before drafting: `learn/benefits/Introduction.md` whole. The README was searched for this topic, not re-read whole.

Scope: high-blast. The outcome can add an engine class or a build artifact and change 66 examples. Divergence is open; nothing here is decided.

## The Concept

The shared examples viewport puts a live component beside a panel of controls that change its reactive configs. That is the smallest honest picture of what the engine is: a persistent object whose state is configuration, changed while it runs.

Today that panel is written by hand in every example, it writes in one direction, and it ends at the example's own window. The question of this sandbox: **if the panel is a product surface and not example scaffolding, what should it become, and for whom?**

The direction has a decision behind it. The Storybook integration was closed as not planned on 2026-06-05, with the operator's reason on `#5010`: "we can create an own neo playground that supports app workers and json vdom. storybook and neo simply do not fit."

## What exists

Read at `origin/dev` `c7e1974483`. These are counts of the current state, not a binding inventory.

- [`examples/ConfigurationViewport.mjs`](https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/c7e1974483/examples/ConfigurationViewport.mjs), 233 lines: the example on the left, a panel titled "Configuration" on the right (350 px minimum), a theme button, and "Log Instance", which writes to the console.
- **66 of the 139 example entrypoints** build on it and override `createConfigurationComponents()`. By folder: form 18, component 16, functional 6, list 5, then eleven folders with one to three each. No app uses it; the eight matches under `apps/` are archived ticket text.
- **580 controls are written by hand** in those 66 files (median 7 per example, maximum 25). They wire 133 distinct config names. `width` is written again in 44 examples and `height` in 34; then `labelText` 17, `labelWidth` 15, `labelPosition` 14, `hideLabel` 14.
- A control writes into the instance: `onConfigChange` is `this.exampleComponent[config] = opts.value`. Nothing is built to flow back. A search for a return path (`.on(`, `afterSet`, `.value =`) finds one in 15 of the 66 files; in the others, a config the component changes itself leaves its control stale.
- Not there: a reset of the whole example, state in the URL, the resulting config object as code, a config's description or type, the events an interaction fires, a size switch. One media query exists (`max-width: 450px`, from `#6477`).
- `ask_knowledge_base` returns nothing for `ConfigurationViewport`. No guide explains it.

**Adjacent primitives that already exist**

- `Neo.code.LivePreview` (`src/code/LivePreview.mjs`): edit source text and see it run, used in the learning section.
- The Neural Link's `inspect_class`, `get_instance_properties` and `set_instance_properties`: an agent reads and changes the same configs on a live instance.
- `Neo.setupClass` keeps each class's config values and descriptors at runtime. It keeps no types: a config's type, allowed values and description live in JSDoc, and the member data is an output of the docs build, not a file in the checkout.

## Divergence matrix (open for peer-added rows)

| Option | When this would be right | Evidence / falsifier |
|---|---|---|
| **A. A better shell, controls stay hand-written.** Two-way sync, reset, state in the URL, the config object as copyable code, a phone layout. | An author's choice of the three configs worth trying is the value. | The census above: `width` and `height` are rewritten 44 and 34 times, and 580 controls cover 133 names. If most controls repeat a handful of configs, curation is repetition and A leaves that cost in place. |
| **B. Controls generated from the class.** The panel lists the reactive configs of whatever instance it is given. | The class already declares what can change, and per-example panel code is waste. | Types and allowed values are not available at runtime. Build the panel for `button.Base` from runtime data alone and count the configs that get a usable control. Second falsifier: a generated list of sixty configs buries the three that matter. |
| **C. Generated, then curated by the catalog record.** The record names the configs to feature; the panel shows those first and the rest on demand. | The Portal caption already tells a visitor what to try (`lookFor`). | Write the featured list for five examples from their current captions. If a caption cannot name configs, the record needs a new field, and C is A with more data. |
| **D. Panel and code as two views of one config object.** A change in the panel rewrites the code; an edit in the code moves the controls. | The reader is a developer who wants to take the result home. | `LivePreview` executes source text, and an instance changed by controls has no source text. Round-trip one example and compare the generated code with what an author would write. |
| **E. One read and write path for a human and an agent.** What the panel can do, an agent can do, and a visitor can watch an agent drive the example. | The panel is the human face of the possession interface. | The public Portal runs production builds without a bridge. If the panel needs the Neural Link, it does not exist where visitors are. An in-app API that the Neural Link also calls would survive this. |
| **F. Leave the viewport, invest in the overviews.** | Visitors look more than they change, and captions and covers carry the section. | No measurement of panel use exists. A counter on control changes on the deployed Portal for one week settles it. |
| **G. Storybook.** | Its ecosystem and addons would come for free. | Falsified on 2026-06-05 on `#5010`, and again by the operator on 2026-11-11: Storybook "is meant for templates, which neo does not have. of course there could be a wrapper component into main threads, but then it gets really ugly. so an own solution feels cleaner." It also needs a build where Neo's development mode has none. Listed so that nobody derives it again. |

## Open Questions

- OQ1 Who is the panel for: a visitor deciding whether the engine is real, a developer learning a class, or an agent? One panel, or one panel with three depths?
- OQ2 Where do a config's type, allowed values and description come from at runtime: a build artifact from JSDoc, inference from the default value, or a declaration on the example?
- OQ3 What can this panel show that only this engine can show? Candidates: the instance persists through every change (no re-mount), the size of the delta one change produced, the same instance driven from a second window. Which of them can be measured honestly in a production build?
- OQ4 Does the playground stay an example base class under `examples/`, or become an engine class that the docs app and other apps reuse?
- OQ5 State in the URL: which configs serialize, and does a shared link reproduce the state on another machine?
- OQ6 At 375 px the panel cannot sit beside the example. Where does it go? The cards promise "Desktop, Mobile".
- OQ7 Is "has a working panel" part of the quality bar for a published example (`#20742`)?
- OQ8 Six functional examples use the asynchronous path. Do the complex examples and the apps get a panel at all, or only single-component examples?

## Graduation criteria

1. The falsifiers of A, B and C have been run on five named examples (a button, a field, the grid, a list, a functional component), and the results are in this body.
2. One rendered sketch of the panel at 1440 and at 375 px is on this Discussion and the operator has read it. The look comes before any build.
3. OQ1, OQ2 and OQ4 carry a resolution tag; a peer has posted the `STEP_BACK` sweep (more than ten files, epic-bound); §6.2 quorum.
4. Target: an epic whose first leaf changes no example.

## Prior art
