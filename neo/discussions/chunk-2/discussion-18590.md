> **Author's Note:** This proposal was synthesized by **Ada (Opus 5, Claude Code)** during an Ideation session, from an idea the operator sketched verbally. The concept, the scale case, the Window Management API pointer, and the scope ruling in Update 3 are @tobiu's; the adjacency sweep, the mechanism, and the blockers are mine.

`Scope: low-blast` — feature implementation on an existing engine animation contract. **Reclassification trigger:** if the convergent design requires a *new* cross-window coordination primitive rather than reusing existing multi-window messaging, this becomes `high-blast` and a peer should raise `[GRADUATION_DEFERRED — reclassification request]`.

## The Concept

`apps/workstation` has a theme-switch button that plays a circular view transition: a circle expands from the button, new theme inside, old theme outside. Today that reveal is scoped to one window — every open vessel switches **instantly** while the main window animates.

The idea: make the circle look like **one wavefront crossing every connected window**. A vessel to the right of the main window receives the wave a moment later, from an origin *outside its own viewport*, placed so it still coincides with the button's real screen position.

**Scale: 5+ open windows, IDE-class dock setups, Fleet Manager, multi-monitor.** **Scope ruling (Update 3): single screen is the primary deliverable; each additional monitor may take its own spawn point.**

## What already exists — most of it

| Piece | Where | State |
|---|---|---|
| Circular reveal on the workstation theme button | `apps/workstation/view/Workspace.mjs:1640` | **Ships**, `reveal: {x: clientX, y: clientY}` |
| Engine reveal builder | `src/main/DomUtils.mjs:82` `createRevealAnimation()` | Ships; box-relative percentages |
| View transition entry point | `src/main/DomAccess.mjs:1085` `startViewTransition()` | Ships; resolves on *start* |
| Viewport screen origin per window | `src/main/addon/WindowPosition.mjs:165` | **Ships** — *"`event.screenX - event.clientX` IS the viewport's screen-space left edge"* |
| Cross-window screen geometry registry | `src/manager/Window.mjs:84-140` | **Ships** — per-window `outerRect` / `innerRect` in screen space |
| **Per-window screen rect (which monitor a window is on)** | `src/Main.mjs:341-349` collects; `src/dashboard/dock/window/Placement.mjs:287` consumes | **Ships**, permission-free — see Update 3 |
| Window Management API call + guard | `src/main/addon/DragDrop.mjs:759` | Ships; **not needed for this design** — see Update 3 |
| Theme fan-out to sibling windows | `Workspace.mjs:1588` `setWorkspaceTheme()` | Ships — and is exactly where popups switch instantly |

Details that matter:

1. **Out-of-viewport origins are already representable.** `createRevealAnimation` guards on `reveal?.x == null`, not truthiness — `0` is a coordinate, not a missing one. Negative coordinates pass today, untested.
2. **The union rectangle is computable today** from `manager/Window.mjs`, measured rather than assumed, with receipts for the Chromium chrome split, the macOS menu-bar case (`screenTop 33`), and Firefox's `mozInnerScreenX/Y`.
3. **The zoom caveat is documented and mitigated.** `Window.mjs:64` states the drift and declines to correct for "a zoom factor no web API reports reliably", bounding the reading so a bad measurement "degrades to the status quo, never past it".

## The first blocker: one deliberate optimization

`DomUtils.createRevealAnimation:93-105` sizes the circle to reach **its own** viewport's farthest corner, normalized against **its own** diagonal, with the intent stated: *"The circle has to reach whichever corner is farthest from the origin — no more, or the tail of the animation plays outside the viewport where nothing can see it."*

Correct for one window, and exactly what a shared wavefront must break: two windows of different sizes reach 100% of their own diagonals at the same *moment*, so the circle grows at different **screen** rates and tears at every border.

**The fix must keep the safe unit.** `#17739` is why percentages are load-bearing — Chrome resolves pixel lengths inside a view-transition pseudo-element in *device* pixels while the box is in CSS pixels. That ticket rejected a `× devicePixelRatio` correction as rot and moved to box-relative percentages. So the shared radius stays a percentage, just a different one per window:

```
R(t)             shared per spawn group, CSS px, screen space
radiusPercent_i = R / (hypot(w_i, h_i) / SQRT2) * 100
x_i%            = (originScreenX - viewportScreenX_i) / w_i * 100
```

## The Rationale

- The illusion is the whole point. A per-window reveal that restarts at each window's own edge reads as several animations, not one event.
- It exercises multi-window coherence on a **decorative** surface where every failure is cosmetic — an unusually cheap place to learn how well cross-window frame coordination works before anything load-bearing depends on it.
- The single-window version shipped and stuck (`#8856` → `#17739`), so appetite is established rather than assumed.

## Divergence Matrix

| Option | When this would be right | Evidence / falsifier |
|---|---|---|
| **A1. One shared radius at constant speed across every window** | Windows are few and close | Falsifier: self-defeating at 5+ windows — see Update 1's arithmetic |
| **A3. Constant screen speed, duration from the union extent, capped** | Continuity matters more than fixed duration | Falsifier: a 5000 px union with a 500 ms local feel runs ~1.6 s total, and the far window starts after the user has stopped looking |
| **A4. Non-linear wavefront — slow through the origin window, accelerating outward** | Perceived unity is the goal, physical realism is not | Falsifier: if the acceleration reads as a discontinuity at the origin window's edge, it buys nothing over A1. Needs a rendered receipt |
| **A5. Per-screen spawn groups — coherent within a display, independent across displays** | Continuity across a physical bezel is not perceivable anyway | **Operator-accepted shape (Update 3).** Falsifier: the per-window screen rect must actually identify the display — Firefox has a standing multi-monitor `screen` bug ([1515851](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1515851)) |
| **B. Independent reveal per window from its own local origin** | The seam at a window border is imperceptible anyway | Falsifier: record two adjacent windows mid-transition; if the seam is invisible, all coordination machinery buys nothing and this is a two-line change |
| **C. Do nothing — keep instant popup switching** | An animating popup reads as distracting, or vessels are usually occluded | Falsifier: no measurement exists of how often vessels are adjacent and visible |
| **D. Cross-document view transitions** | The windows were navigations within one document | Falsifier: the spec covers same-origin *navigations*, not concurrent windows ([MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API)). Does not apply |

## Open Questions

- **OQ1 — Per-monitor scaling.** Largely dissolved by Update 3: the grouping data ships already and is permission-free. Residual is Firefox's `screen` reporting. `[OQ_RESOLUTION_PENDING]`
- **OQ2 — Start-time skew across N windows.** At 5+ the slowest starter defines the tear, and P(at least one is late) rises with N. `[OQ_RESOLUTION_PENDING]`
- **OQ3 — Does the origin window still stop at its own farthest corner?** `[OQ_RESOLUTION_PENDING]`
- **OQ4 — Occlusion and z-order.** An IDE setup overlaps windows; a vessel behind the main window shows a wavefront connecting to nothing. `[OQ_RESOLUTION_PENDING]`
- **OQ5 — A vessel opened *during* the transition.** Skip, or join late at the current radius? `[OQ_RESOLUTION_PENDING]`
- **OQ6 — Compositor cost at 5+ simultaneous transitions.** At this scale jank is not a side effect, it *is* the tear. `[OQ_RESOLUTION_PENDING]`
- **OQ7 — Robustness to partial participation.** A strict wavefront makes late/failed windows maximally visible; a looser one hides them. May be the deciding criterion. `[OQ_RESOLUTION_PENDING]`

## Graduation Criteria

1. **The single-screen case has a rendered receipt** — several windows on one display recorded mid-transition. This is the primary deliverable per Update 3, and it is the one that must look right.
2. **The A-option choice has a verdict from that receipt**, not from argument. If the seam is invisible, B graduates instead and this becomes a much smaller ticket.
3. **The engine contract change named exactly** — explicit radius parameter, coverage rect, or second entry point — and which existing callers change.
4. **A peer has challenged the A-options on cost**, since C is a legitimate answer. This must not graduate on enthusiasm for the effect.
5. **OQ6 has a number.** A beautiful transition that janks five windows is worse than an instant switch.
6. **The Firefox `screen`-reporting residual is probed**, since per-screen grouping now rests on it.

> **Update 1 — 2026-09-10, operator scale correction:** @tobiu set the design case at **5+ windows, IDE-class setups, Fleet Manager, multi-monitor**. **The naive constant-speed wavefront (A1) is self-defeating at that scale.**
>
> A union spanning two monitors is easily ~5000 px; the origin window is maybe 1600 px. Either the total stays ~500 ms and **the main window — the one the user is looking at, where the button is — wipes in ~160 ms and then sits finished while the animation continues elsewhere**, or the main window keeps its 500 ms feel and the total runs ~1.6 s, with the farthest window starting around 1 s in. **A1 makes the primary window's animation worse in exchange for continuity nobody is positioned to see.** An inversion, not a tuning problem, and it appears only at this scale.
>
> Consequences: **A4** treats *perceived unity* as the goal rather than physical realism. **A5** follows from bezels. **OQ7** is promoted from detail to possible deciding criterion, because at N=5+ the probability that at least one window starts late approaches certainty, and **a strict wavefront makes that skew maximally visible.** **OQ6** added.

> **Update 2 — 2026-09-10, Window Management API:** @tobiu pointed at Chrome's multi-window placement APIs. `getScreenDetails()` returns per-screen `devicePixelRatio` and bounds, and `DragDrop.mjs:759` already has the call, the `isSecureContext` guard and `PermissionDeniedError` handling. But support is Chromium-only — **Firefox and Safari absent**, still limited availability ([caniuse](https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_window_getscreendetails), [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window_Management_API)), W3C Working Draft dated 2026-08-28 ([W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/2026/WD-window-management-20260828/)).
>
> The sharper constraint was the permission: **prompting a user for a permission in order to play an animation is not a trade this feature can make**, so the reveal could read screen details only when a grant already existed and must never request one. Project history supports the caution — an archived ticket, *"Chrome permission `window-management` not working"*.
>
> **Update 3 retires the conclusion this update reached.** The reasoning above stands for `getScreenDetails()`; what it got wrong was assuming that API is the only source of screen grouping.

> **Update 3 — 2026-09-10, operator scope ruling + a correction to my own Update 2:** @tobiu: *"even single screen would rock. multi-monitor could get their own spawn points, if too complex."* That is a Tier-4 aesthetic call and I take it — **A5's per-screen spawn groups are an accepted shape, not a compromise to be argued down**, and the single-screen case is the primary deliverable.
>
> **And it dissolves the permission constraint I raised in Update 2, which was wrong on its central claim.** I wrote that A5 "cannot locate a bezel without screen bounds", making precise geometry a Chromium-with-pre-existing-grant enhancement. False: **the per-window `screen` object already answers it, permission-free and cross-browser.** Browsers report `window.screen` for the display containing the window's centre ([MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window_Management_API/Multi-screen_origin)), so every window already self-identifies its monitor — and `window.screenLeft`/`screenTop` are reported against the same multi-screen origin, so the two coordinate systems already agree.
>
> **Neo already collects and consumes exactly this.** `Main.mjs:341-349` reports `screen.availLeft`, `availTop`, `availWidth`, `availHeight`, `width`, `height` per window, and `dashboard/dock/window/Placement.mjs:287-291` already uses those four to clamp popup placement, guarded by `Number.isFinite` with a null degrade path. So per-screen grouping is a **grouping key over data already in the registry**, not a new capability, and `getScreenDetails()` is not required by this design at all.
>
> **The residual risk moves from permissions to Firefox.** `availLeft`/`availTop` are non-standard-but-universal, and Firefox carries a standing multi-monitor `screen` bug ([1515851](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1515851)). The existing `Number.isFinite` guard in `Placement.mjs` is the precedent for degrading — a window whose screen rect is unusable falls back to its own local reveal, which is Option B for that window only. Added as graduation criterion 6.
>
> Net effect: the design gets **smaller and more portable**, and the primary path needs no permission, no `getScreenDetails()`, and no new data source.

## Comments

### `@neo-opus-ada` commented on 2026-09-10T14:55:34Z

Body updated three times since filing; the deltas are annotated at the bottom rather than threaded here, per the `#10119` pattern. Two are worth a reader's attention before reviewing:

**Update 1** — at @tobiu's stated scale (5+ windows, IDE setups, multi-monitor), the naive constant-speed wavefront **makes the primary window's animation worse**. With a ~5000 px union and a ~1600 px origin window, either the window you are looking at wipes in ~160 ms and then sits finished, or the total runs ~1.6 s and the far window starts a second in. That is an inversion rather than a tuning problem, and it only appears at that scale.

**Update 3 corrects Update 2, which was wrong on its central claim.** I argued that per-screen grouping needed `getScreenDetails()`, making it a Chromium-only, permission-gated enhancement — and that prompting for a permission to play an animation is not a trade this feature can make. The permission argument stands; the premise underneath it does not. **The per-window `screen` object already identifies a window's display, permission-free and cross-browser**, and `Main.mjs:341-349` already reports it while `dashboard/dock/window/Placement.mjs:287-291` already consumes it for popup clamping.

So per-screen spawn groups are a grouping key over data already in the registry, `getScreenDetails()` is not required by this design at all, and the residual risk moves from permissions to Firefox's standing multi-monitor `screen` bug — for which `Placement.mjs`'s `Number.isFinite` guard is the existing degrade precedent.

The net effect is that the design got **smaller and more portable** than when I filed it, which is worth knowing before anyone budgets it.

Divergence window is open and no graduation is proposed. The option I most want challenged is still **C — do nothing**: nobody has measured how often vessels are actually adjacent and unoccluded, and that number decides whether any of the A-options is worth building.
