# core.Base: isConstructed config

defaults to false.

we need a hook inside Neo.create() to change it to true.

afterSetIsConstructed needs to fire an event.

## Timeline

ok, this is impossible, since we can not use configs with a trailing underscore inside core.Base.

instead, we can use `isConstructed` and trigger a new onAfterConstructed method inside Neo.create().
