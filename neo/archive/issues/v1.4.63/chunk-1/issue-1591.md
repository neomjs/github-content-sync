# Neo classes: method order

I started with putting a few methods on top of each class: 
constructor, onConstructed, init, mergeConfig, getVdomRoot, getVnodeRoot.

At this point it feels rather confusing, so I will change this approach:
constructor first, all other methods in chronological (alphabetical) order.
