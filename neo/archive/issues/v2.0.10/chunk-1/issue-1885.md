# Covid.view.MainContainerController: onMainViewMounted()

after switching to lazy load all covid app main tabs, we can no longer use `onMainViewMounted()` since at this point at most 1 tab is there.

instead, we need to trigger the logic when a new tab gets activated. `onHashChange()` could work.

diving into this now.
