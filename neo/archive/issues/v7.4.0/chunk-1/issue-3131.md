# component.Base: hidden_ config

@Dinkh 

we should create a new config, which enables us to check the hidden state as well as changing it.

this will also allow us to do bulk-updates in a convenient way:
```
myComponent.set({
    disabled: true,
    hidden  : true
})
```

internally we will need an `afterSetHidden()` method to handle the updates. this one could call the `hide()` and `show()` methods, in case it provides extra value.

e.g. hide / show could get a param to override the `hideMode` config for specific calls.

### @tobiu - 2022-06-07T10:46:03Z

if we are keeping the show / hide methods, they should silently update the hidden state as well.

`this._hidden = {Boolean};`

### @Dinkh - 2022-06-07T12:04:46Z

I would prefer to be able to hide/show on node and component level.

Neo.show('nodeId' | 'componentId') / Neo.hide('nodeId' | 'componentId')

In addition the components should get a _hidden and _disabled config

#19489 set C · T4 · Grace · 2026-10-09: **already delivered, so the close reason is corrected to completed.** `component.Base` has `hidden_` with `afterSetHidden()`.
