# Store loading catch error not working

If the url for a store is not working (404) it is not getting into the promiseJson catch part but the then part.
And there it crashes.
```
Neo.Xhr.promiseJson({
    url: params.url
}).catch(err => {
    console.log('Error for Neo.Xhr.request', err, me.id);
}).then(data => {
//==> here instead of above
    me.data = Array.isArray(data.json) ? data.json : data.json.data;
    // we do not need to fire a load event => onCollectionMutate()
});
```

To reproduce just set the store url to
```
    url: '[QUARANTINED_URL: test.json]'
```

#19489 set C · T4 · Grace · 2026-10-09: **already delivered, so the close reason is corrected to completed.** Thank you @Dinkh. Store loading goes through `data.connection.Fetch`, which rejects any non-ok response, so a 404 reaches the catch.
