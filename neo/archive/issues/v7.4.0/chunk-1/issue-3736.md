# Stores should support a Reader

Sometimes data for a store are delivered in a strange way.
Instead of using a request and populate the store after working with the data, I would like to see a reader, which prepares the incoming data.

The reader should contain a function that allows the developer to transform the incoming data and return the data, in a way the model understands it.

#19489 set C · T4 · Grace · 2026-10-09: **already delivered, so the close reason is corrected to completed.** Thank you @Dinkh. Stores read through `data.Pipeline` (with parsers and normalizers) and `responseRoot`.
