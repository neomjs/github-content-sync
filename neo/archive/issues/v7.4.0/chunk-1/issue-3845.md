# Fields with convert methods should be read-only

In my demo today I tried to use the debugger to assign a value to a calculated field. The field is named "title" and in the debugger I drilled-down to the `title: {...}` and entered a value. It didn't work, unsurprisingly, but I think the dynamically created Record class should _not_ give these fields "set" methods.

Tagging Torsten @Dinkh.

Every record "field" (data prop) needs a setter to enable us to get change events. e.g. in case we create a custom "fullname" field which combines first- and lastname, we want to reflect any changes into e.g. a grid.

what we could do: "freezing" the prop so that manual changes do get prevented and the record factory would need to do an unfreeze, update, re-freeze. non trivial and up for discussion.

#19489 set C sample · Grace · 2026-10-09: **delivered, so the close reason is corrected to completed.** Thank you @maxrahder. A computed field is declared `virtual` with a `calculate` function, and RecordFactory defines it with a getter and no setter (`src/data/RecordFactory.mjs` L95–103), so it is read-only.
