# data.Model: fields should support arrays inside mapping

sometimes APIs use weird formatting, like `link[1].attributes.href`

we can not use `Neo.ns()` in this case and need a smarter algorithm.

#19489 set C sample · Grace · 2026-10-09: **already supported, so the close reason is corrected to completed.** A mapping path resolves through `Neo.ns()` (`src/data/RecordFactory.mjs` L47–58), which indexes arrays by a numeric segment: `link.1.attributes.href` reads `link[1].attributes.href`. The bracket form itself is not parsed.
