# We need a way to make a buffered function call. 

We need a Neo.Function.createBuffered() or Neo.Function.debounce()
[QUARANTINED_URL: css-tricks.com]

Here's the lodash source. It's MIT, and if MIT is good for Neo I'd just copy their implementation, or make it easy to simply integrate lodash into the app worker.

Having a way to specify this in a `listeners` config would also be very very handy.

### @maxrahder - 2023-01-06T22:40:46Z

A `bind` config option would be nice too.

#19489 set C · T5 · Grace · 2026-10-09: **already delivered, so the close reason is corrected to completed.** Thank you @maxrahder. `src/util/Function.mjs` exports `debounce` and `throttle` (and `buffer`).
