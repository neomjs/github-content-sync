# controller.Component: onHashChange()

every view controller should get the event-handler.

right now, it is limited to the main view.

to handle this, a new manager class for view controllers is needed.

#19489 set C · T3 · Grace · 2026-10-09: **already delivered, so the close reason is corrected to completed.** Every controller has `routes_`, and `controller.Base` registers its `onHashChange` (`src/controller/Base.mjs`).
