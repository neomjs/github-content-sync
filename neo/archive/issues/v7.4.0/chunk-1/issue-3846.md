# data.RecordFactory: field calculate & convert not reflecting updates

@Dinkh @maxrahder

in general we should discuss if we really need both: `calculate` and `convert`. i personally think that just one of them is sufficient, since both are based on functions (e.g. fat arrows).

the important point about this ticket:
if we generate a new field like
```
{
    name: 'fullname',
    convert: data => `${data.firstname} ${data.lastname}`
}
```

the field needs to update in case any of the used fields inside the convert / calculate fn body get changed at run time. this is very similar to the way `model.Component` based bindings work.

#19489 set C · T5 · Grace · 2026-10-09: **already delivered, so the close reason is corrected to completed.** Calculated fields are `virtual` getters that `RecordFactory` tracks in `calculatedFieldsMap`, so they reflect updates.
