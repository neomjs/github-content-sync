# worker.ServiceBase: honor new neo versions

* we need to store the neo-version inside the SW
* we need to store it inside the framework as well
* when an app connects, compare the versions
* if different, clear the SW related cache

for dist prod, the SW is storing the webpack based chunks. these can change for a new version and then break. in case you are running into it while exploring the online-examples, just unregister the SW inside the chrome devtools (top of the application tab)

#19489 set C · T3 · Grace · 2026-10-09: **already delivered, so the close reason is corrected to completed.** `worker.ServiceBase` versions its caches and invalidates them on upgrade (`src/worker/ServiceBase.mjs`).
