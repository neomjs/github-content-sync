# buildScripts/buildThemes: app folders inside the workspace evn

Right now, the theme build will first parse all files within the neo repo (node module) and afterwards parse all files within the workspace.

The result is, that the CSS output will also include the `apps` from within the neo repo itself. While it is not a big deal, since apps won't use these CSS files, they should get excluded.

#19489 set C · T4 · Grace · 2026-10-09: **already delivered, so the close reason is corrected to completed.** `themes.mjs` handles workspace builds separately and skips the engine's `apps.*` classes there.
