# vdom.Helper: add support for a top level `html` property

While child vdom nodes support a html property, the top level seems limited to only allow `innerHTML` instead.

We should get rid of `innerHTML` anyway, so adding support for `html` inside the creation logic feels like a good step for getting there.
