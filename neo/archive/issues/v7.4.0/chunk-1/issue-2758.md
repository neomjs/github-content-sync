# Consider using the window placement API?

[QUARANTINED_URL: web.dev]
It would be nice to remember window position

Hi @LifeIsStrange,

I actually chatted about this topic with the author Thomas ( @tomayac ) a while ago on Twitter. I definitely like the API, except for being limited to Chromium at that point in time (did this change?).

Sadly, both of us have not found the time yet to create a PoC version & demo.

Implementation-wise it should be pretty straight forward. We need a new optional main thread addon, similar to the ones here: https://github.com/neomjs/neo/tree/dev/src/main/addon and create methods which honor the API and expose these as remotes (remote method access) to the App worker.

In case someone wants to create a PR, it would be appreciated.

Best regards,
Tobias

Thanks for your interest! Chromium is wrapping up the second Origin Trial in M-96 and would appreciate any feedback before pursuing a stable release. See the explainer [QUARANTINED_URL: github.com] and/or draft spec [QUARANTINED_URL: webscreens.github.io] for API details. Feel free to file github issues, leave feedback [QUARANTINED_URL: github.com], or reach out with any questions. Developer feedback and support motivates other browser vendors to consider adopting APIs like this.

@tobiu to be clear I have not the time/will to implement the feature although I am curious about this API

#19489 set C · T3 · Grace · 2026-10-09: **already delivered, so the close reason is corrected to completed.** Thank you @LifeIsStrange. The Window Management API (the successor of window placement) is in use: `src/main/addon/DragDrop.mjs` calls `window.getScreenDetails()`.
