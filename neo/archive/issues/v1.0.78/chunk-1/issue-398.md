# component.Helix: wheel event while rendering items

throws JS errors. there needs to be a check if items are rendering and if so ignore the wheel event.

## Timeline

### @tobiu - 2020-03-30T12:01:42Z

there was more to it: the API load request could arrive before the helix got mounted and tried to create the items before this point.

this one is fixed now plus added a mousewheel lock for 0.5s when createItems() gets triggered.
