# form.field.Select: list keyNav broken

will look into it.

## Timeline

### @tobiu - 2020-03-18T12:59:27Z

related to the change that all dom events bubble up now.

in this case, the key down & up bubble from the list to the field, which should not happen.

### @tobiu - 2020-03-18T13:45:41Z

util.KeyNavigation now uses the new "bubble" config => false for the keydown event.
