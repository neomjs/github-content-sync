# Theme neo light: splitter scss file needs a cleanup

related to: https://github.com/neomjs/neo/issues/5362

for some of the overrides, we already have theming vars. e.g. `background-color`.

for other rules, new theming vars probably make sense.

see:
https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/resources/scss/src/component/Splitter.scss
https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/resources/scss/theme-neo-light/component/Splitter.scss

#19489 set C · T7 · Grace · 2026-10-09: **already delivered, so the close reason is corrected to completed.** The theme file only sets `--splitter-*` variables, and `resources/scss/src/component/Splitter.scss` styles through them.
