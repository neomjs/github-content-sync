# component.Base: needsVdomUpdate => needsVdomUpdate_

and create an afterSetNeedsVdomUpdate() inside container.Base

if a roundtrip starts for a container, the entire vdom tree of all child containers / components will get sent to the vdom worker.

so it would be fair to say: all children on any levels can set their need update state to false.

same amount of deltas, but less calls to the engine.
