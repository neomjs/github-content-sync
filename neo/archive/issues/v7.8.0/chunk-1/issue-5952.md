# Portal.view.learn.ContentComponent: on record change => existing neo child instances

related to: https://github.com/neomjs/neo/issues/5951

@maxrahder @rwaters:
it should work more like a component based list => if the current view has 5 LivePreview instances and the new view needs 3, let us re-use the existing 3 and create 2 new ones. delete "overflowing" instances.

i will work on it.

## Timeline

### @tobiu - 2024-09-21T19:22:47Z

just destroying all child instances for now. we can open a follow-up ticket for re-using them.
