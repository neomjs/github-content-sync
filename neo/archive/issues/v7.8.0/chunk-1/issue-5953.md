# Portal.view.learn.ContentComponent: not re-rendering child components on re-mounting

@maxrahder @rwaters:

Navigating within the learning section works fine. However, in case we navigate from "Learn" to "Blog", "Home" etc., the learning view will get unmounted. Navigating back to "Learn" => the last active page and LivePreviews are completely missing.
