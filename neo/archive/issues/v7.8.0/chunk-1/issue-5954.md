# collection.Base: isItem() has to return true for "object like" items

```
    isItem(value) {
        return Neo.isObject(value) || Neo.isRecord(value)
    }
```

the change happened, when introducing `Neo.isRecord()` and making `Neo.isObject()` super strict to only return true for real objects.

collections however can contain neo instances as items, which no longer get recognised.

if the recognition no longer works, removing items will break, which can result in growing memory leaks when frequently removing items.
