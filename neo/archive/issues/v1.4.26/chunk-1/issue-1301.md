# tab.header.Toolbar: afterSetSortable() => ensure to not create multiple sortZones

same for container.Toolbar.

if we set sortable to true, then to false and back to true, there has to be a check in place to not re-create the sortZone.

i think it makes sense to keep it when dynamically(!) setting it to false, since there is a good chance to re-activate it later on.
