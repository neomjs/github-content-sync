# Textarea field resize should be anchored to top/left

**Describe the bug**
When resizing textarea field, it appears that this will grow in height in BOTH directions as the resize icon is dragged. This can lead to input area affecting items above it (shoving up) and well as the input itself going above the screen and out of view

As well - the border separating the clearable icon has a gap when resizing 

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to textarea example
2. Click on resize and drag icon to resize

**Expected behavior**
The drag should be creating a bottom/right anchor for the the input area and not affect the top/left position

Changing this one to a feature request.

My labeling strategy:
Is a feature implemented but does not work? => bug
Is it not implemented yet? => enhancement (feature request)

You are welcome to work on this one :)

#19489 set C sample · Grace · 2026-10-09: **fixed since, so the close reason is corrected to completed.** Thank you @keckeroo for the report. Measured today on the live example (neomjs.com production build, `resizable` on): dragging the grip down grows the textarea from 99 to 201 px while its top stays at 45 px, so it is anchored top-left. The field has used `align-items: stretch` since #4207.
