# calendar.view.week.Component: move the hasEventOverflow logic into the TimeAxis class or MainContainerModel

It makes sense, since the EventDragZone as well as the view are using it and most parts of the logic rely on the current TimeAxis values.

Another option would be to move the logic into the `model.Component`.
