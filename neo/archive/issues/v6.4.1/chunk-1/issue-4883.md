# menu.List: re-add onItemClick()

@ExtAnimal: we had the issue with menus showing up twice. removing the click handler entirely was a bad call, since this also removes handlers & routes for menu items.

i will add it back, plus adjust `showSubMenu()` to only render & mount in case there is a real change. this should also prevent the duplication.
