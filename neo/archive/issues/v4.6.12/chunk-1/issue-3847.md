# Outdated documentation

**Describe the bug**
On the concept page [QUARANTINED_URL: github.com] there is a statement that Safari doesn't support the JS modules inside web workers: 

> Firefox & Safari do not support JS modules inside workers yet, so the development mode only runs in Chrome v80+. Of course the dist (dev&prod) versions do run fine in FF & Safari as well.

Safari supports import declaration in workers since version 15:

[QUARANTINED_URL: developer.mozilla.org]

This part should be updated to include only Firefox.
