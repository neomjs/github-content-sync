# form.field.CheckBox: JS based icon classes

sadly, it is not easily possible to use dynamic content in pseudo elements, like:
```
&::after {
    content: var(--neo-icon-checked)
}
```

since the browser does not acknowledge this to be a string and does not render the node at all.

so, we do need JS based configs instead.
