# table.Container: beforeSetStore() => listeners

we should add an `afterSetStore()` method which dynamically assigns the listeners via `on()`.

otherwise, in case devs specify their own listeners, they will get overridden.

#19489 set C · T5 · Grace · 2026-10-09: **already delivered, so the close reason is corrected to completed.** `table.Container#afterSetStore` attaches its listeners with `on()`, so developer listeners survive.
