# component.Base: allow vdom updates for sub trees

inside components with rather big vdom structures like `table.View`, it would be nice if we can just pass a child vdom & vnode tree to the vdom worker to check for delta updates (in this specific case a table row or even cell).

the logic will need to replace the vnode at the correct spot inside the vnode tree, once the delta comparison is done.
