# dialog.Base: hide() & show() should honor the mounted (or hidden) state

hide => only execute the logic if the dialog is mounted

show => only execute the logic in case the dialog is not mounted

related to #4547

#19489 set C · T5 · Grace · 2026-10-09: **already delivered, so the close reason is corrected to completed.** `dialog.Base` no longer overrides `hide()` / `show()`; the component's own hidden and mounted handling applies.
