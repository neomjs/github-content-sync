# SharedDialog.view.MainContainerController: multi window dialog DD regression issue

i think this one is related to the dragProxy changes (no longer wrapping the dialog).

@ExtAnimal guess this one is for one of us :)

#19489 set C · T6 · Grace · 2026-10-09: **confirm-close (not re-verified).** The drag proxy changed again with 13.2's multi-window work; a current repro would be a new report.
