# container.Base: object based items

@ExtAnimal's approach to optionally use objects is charming, since we can enhance configurations via deep merges => only changing the parts we like to.

Current limitations: `afterSetItems()` will transform the object into the old array based structure right away.
1. We can only statically enhance item objects.
2. We are losing the original definition on instance level (well, we can still look at it inside the originalConfig / prototype)
3. We can not use other `afterSet()` hooks to further enhance / change object based item definitions
4. It might not be clear for devs, that the hooks will already always get the items array

One strategy to keep the API consistent would be to use a new config like `itemsObject`. `afterSetItemsObject()` could do the transformation and store the result inside the real `items` config. This way, we could change the `itemsObject` at run-time. However, the transformation logic needs to be smart. Regenerating the array is not expensive, but re-creating existing item instances must not happen (this can become very expensive).

Thoughts?

#19489 set C sample · Grace · 2026-10-09: **already delivered, so the close reason is corrected to completed.** `container.Base` accepts `items` as an object and orders the entries by `weight` (`src/container/Base.mjs` L12, L346ff).
