# [discuss] form.field.Select => form.field.Combobox refactoring

@ExtAnimal @mxmrtns 

Max would like to see a `SelectField` implementation which is based on `select` and `option` tags.

Imho a ComboBox can already handle the functionality (via `editable: false)` and a real `SelectField` would add all options directly into the DOM. However, I am open minded :)

If you decide that the separation makes sense, we will need to rename the current `form.field.Select` into `form.field.ComboBox` (scope of this ticket) and then create a follow up ticket to create a new `form.field.Select`. The new implementation should be pretty easy.

In case you decide to just stick to the current implementation, this ticket can also get closed.
