# view.country.Table: afterSetCountry()

looks like a new regression bug:
in case we open the app with a different route than the table and then navigate to it, the `table.View` can still be undefined.

### @tobiu - 2023-08-12T18:22:54Z

if we are going this route, we also need a check on `afterSetMounted()` to apply selections.

an alternative would be that `getView()` creates the `table.View`, in case it did not get created yet.
