# Panel Header should not be inline with the layout

Is:
If you create a `panel` with a `dock` -top `header` and `items` with layout `hbox`, the docked item will be aligned to the left.

What I expect:
The docked item should be aligned top and the two items underneath should be left to right

Example:

```
ntype: 'panel',
headers: [{
    dock: 'top'
}],
layout: {ntype: 'hbox', align: 'stretch'},
items: [{
    html: 'item a'
}, {
    html: 'item b'
}]
```

#19489 set C · T5 · Grace · 2026-10-09: **confirm-close (settled).** Thank you @Dinkh. By design, a panel's own layout arranges its headers and body; the items' layout goes into `containerConfig` (`src/container/Panel.mjs`).
