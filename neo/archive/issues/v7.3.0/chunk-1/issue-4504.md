# form.field.Picker display issue in container.Dialog

**Describe the bug**
When I use Select or Date field in dialog container, the picker container stays behind the dialog.

**Additional context**
The new dialog tag is in top layer and this ignore the z-index. 

**Possible solution**
the picker parent should be dialog container.

#19489 set C sample · Grace · 2026-10-09: **confirm-close (obsolete).** Thank you @pensuwan-k for the clear diagnosis. Its cause was the native `<dialog>` top layer, and no component renders one any more: `container.Dialog` is gone, and `Neo.dialog.Base` is a regular element with a `neo-modal` class. If a picker still opens behind a dialog, please open a new issue with the example.
