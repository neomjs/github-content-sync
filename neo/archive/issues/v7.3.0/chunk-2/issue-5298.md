# Portal.view.learn.PageSectionsPanel: scrolling the main content should update the list selection on the right side

@maxrahder @mxmrtns @ExtAnimal 

this might be a bit tricky. we need to listen to a scroll event and need to get the info which `h2` tag inside the content is the topmost visible one.

#19489 set C sample · Grace · 2026-10-09: **already delivered, so the close reason is corrected to completed.** The learn view selects the visible section as the content scrolls: `onIntersect()` in `apps/portal/view/learn/MainContainerController.mjs` (L57) selects its record in the page-sections list, fed by `main.addon.IntersectionObserver` (#5306, #5314).
