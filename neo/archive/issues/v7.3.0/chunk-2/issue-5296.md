# Portal.view.learn.PageSectionsPanel: styling

hi max,

for now the list is just using the same CSS as the TreeList:
```
        items: [{
            module: List,
            bind  : {store: 'stores.contentSections'},
            cls   : ['topics-tree']
        }]
```

you are welcome to change this anyway you like to :)
