# Enhance the RealWorld demo app with lazy loading

Just took a look into the code and it should be pretty simple.

mostly:
RealWorld.view.MainContainer
RealWorld.view.MainContainerController

=> remove the static imports for all views and go for dynamic ones instead. webpack can easily handle it now.

Thoughts? @mrsunshine
