# model.Component: getPlainData()

the current approach:
```
return JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(this.data));
```

works well for only getting the values inside an object tree structure (excluding custom get() / set() based props), but it is not sufficient for non primitive values. E.g. dates get replaced by strings, which is bad.
