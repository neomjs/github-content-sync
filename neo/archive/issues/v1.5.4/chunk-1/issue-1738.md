# model.Component: resolveFormatter() => keep the generated function as minimal as possible

@bhaustein mentioned that it would be nicer to move the
```Javascript
if (!data) {
    data = this.getHierarchyData();
}
```

part out of the generated fn. Since we are only calling it inside `resolveFormatter()` I agree.
