# list.Base: focus outlines are getting cut off

the easiest solution for now is using `outline-offset: -1px;`.

we can create a follow-up ticket to discuss about other options (like removing `overflow: hidden`). however, this would be expensive regarding browser reflow OPs.

added a new theme var to make it configurable: `--list-item-focus-outline-offset`

@tobiu This feels very much like a hack to me. I would rather add a padding with focus-outline-width. 
On the other hand can you put a number to what are the implications if we would get rid of overflow hidden? Like in ms?
