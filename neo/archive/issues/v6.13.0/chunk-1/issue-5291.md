# remove src/data/field

the idea to use `data.Model` instances as records and `data.field.*` instances inside of these got dropped right from the start.

we use the `data.RecordFactory` instead to keep records as lightweight as possible.

while we might reconsider this in the future, right now we should just delete the folder to not confuse developers.
