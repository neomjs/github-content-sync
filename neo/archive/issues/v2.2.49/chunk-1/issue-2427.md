# calendar.view.CalendarsContainer: convert the container into a list

Thinking more about this one, a list makes more sense.

We get KeyNav and can select items (calendars). When creating a new event, the selected calendar list item gets the priority.

List items need to include checkbox fields as well as a click to edit icon (only visible on hover).

more precisely: add a list as a container item.
