# Triangle-based worker communication for app => vdom => main => app 

In case we render & mount a component or in case we do a vdom update, the worker messages are running like this:
**app => main => vdom => main => app**

We can reduce this to:
**app => vdom => main => app**

To do this, we need to create a new `MessageChannel` for the vdom worker, similar to the ones for the canvas and data workers. However, we only need to register one port (since messages back from vdom still need to drop the deltas inside main).

We still want to delay sending a reply from main to app until the deltas got processed by the `renderAnimationFrame` queue.

## Timeline

### @tobiu - 2022-02-05T15:44:58Z

to enable the same pattern for the `SharedWorker` scope, we need to match worker ports and appNames inside all available workers.
