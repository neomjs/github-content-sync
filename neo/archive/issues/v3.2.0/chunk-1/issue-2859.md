# calendar.view.week.Component: drag-create an event for an unchecked calendar

In case we uncheck a calendar inside the list on the left side, all events will become invisible inside the week view.

In case we drag on the week view afterwards to create a new event, we will get a JS error.

It feels cleaner in case we disable the drag-start for inactive calendars.

this affects the logic inside `calendar.view.week.plugin.DragDrop`
