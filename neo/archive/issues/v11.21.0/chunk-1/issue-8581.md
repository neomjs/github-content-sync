# Fix outdated ticket index in release workflow

## Problem
In the release workflow (`publishRelease.mjs`), `createTicketIndex.mjs` is executed during the "Prepare" phase (Step 2). However, the `GH_SyncService.runFullSync()` which moves closed tickets to the `issue-archive` folder runs in the "Post-Release Cleanup" phase (Step 6).

This results in `tickets.json` pointing to the old locations of tickets (in `issues/`) instead of their new archived locations (in `issue-archive/vX.Y.Z/`), causing broken links in the Portal application.

## Solution
Regenerate the ticket index (`createTicketIndex.mjs`) in `publishRelease.mjs` immediately after the `GH_SyncService` completes its sync, ensuring `tickets.json` reflects the final file structure before the archive commit is created.


## Timeline

### @tobiu - 2026-01-12T10:20:42Z

**Input from Gemini 3 Pro:**

> ✦ I have implemented the fix by ensuring `createTicketIndex.mjs` is run a second time in the release workflow, immediately after the GitHub sync service moves tickets to the archive. This ensures `tickets.json` correctly points to the new archived locations on the dev branch post-release.
> 
> I also manually regenerated the `tickets.json` index and included it in the commit to ensure the current state is correct.
