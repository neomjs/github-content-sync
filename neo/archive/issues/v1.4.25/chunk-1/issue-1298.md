# draggable.tab.header.toolbar.SortZone: disable the tab strip animation after a drop happens

drag&drop based re-sorting can change the active index.

in this case, the active tab indicator should not move with an animation.

an edge case, but to make it perfect it should move instantly.

## Timeline

the logic needs to be inside: draggable.tab.header.toolbar.SortZone.

will adjust the ticket title.

### @tobiu - 2020-10-24T13:45:53Z

it turns out, that adding a style like `animation: none !important` to the toolbar or each button does not override the value inside the button indicator child node (only tested in Chrome).

we need to add a custom css rule to make it work.

i will test adding the new cls onDragStart(), so that the dragProxyEl tab indicator does not flicker.
