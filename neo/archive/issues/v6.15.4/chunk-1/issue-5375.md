# collection.Base: destroy() => edge case, can get called more than once with VM based stores which get bound in multiple cmps.

i think `core.Base: destroy()` should set a flag like `isDestroyed`.

then all class extensions should check for this flag, before doing their logic.

thoughts? @ExtAnimal
