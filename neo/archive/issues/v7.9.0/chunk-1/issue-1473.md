# examples.tree => draggable: true for dist versions

while it does work fine inside the dev mode, it does not inside the dist env.

the "neo-draggable" css class does not get applied to tree nodes.

it could be related to the store.load() timing.

will take a closer look into draggable.list.DragZone.

`adjustListItemCls()` gets triggered at a different time indeed.

dev mode: owner rendered === false, owner rendering === true

dist dev: owner rendered === false, owner rendering === false
