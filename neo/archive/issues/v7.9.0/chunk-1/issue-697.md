# Webkit: Reinstate support for SharedWorkers

https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=149850

Please help creating an awareness for the Webkit team that we need SharedWorkers.

Mobile: Native shell with multiple WebViews.

To be clear: they *dropped* working on SharedWorkers on purpose and it won't happen unless smart devs like you add some weight on it.

Every(!) browser on iOS is using Webkit.

Just need to wait until it gets moved from Safari Tech Preview to the default version.
