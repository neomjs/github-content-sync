# plugin.Resizable: import draggable.DragZone => resize logic

we need to map the DragZone to the handles (neo-resizable).

register drag:start, move and end to the plugin owner.

onDragMove: either resize the real element or a dragProxy of it.
a proxyEl might be better for cancelling the operation (ESC).

#19489 set C · T2 · Grace · 2026-10-09: **already delivered, so the close reason is corrected to completed.** `plugin.Resizable` runs on a `draggable.DragZone` (`dragZone` / `dragZoneConfig`).
