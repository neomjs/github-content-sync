# component.Base: edge case where delta updates start when child updates are already in progress

![Screenshot 2024-06-23 at 21 22 52](https://github.com/neomjs/neo/assets/1177434/178a3c41-2bc4-4d95-8a82-85d2456e5196)

this one needs brainstorming. while we could further polish the edge-cases, the fine grained major updates version would resolve it out of the box: https://github.com/orgs/neomjs/discussions/5408

we need to make a decision into which direction to move forward.
