perhaps the "opts appName"  gotcha?

for neo 6.9.0 

```
diff table/View.mjs.orig table/View.mjs.orig.scrollfix
240c240
<                 Neo.main.DomAccess.scrollToTableRow({id: selectedRows[0]});
---
>                 Neo.main.DomAccess.scrollToTableRow({id: selectedRows[0], appName: me.appName});
```

### @tobiu - 2023-10-19T08:20:32Z

the `appName` should indeed get used inside all remote methods => window identifier, important for the shared workers scope.

will add it.
