# tree.List: ctor => throw an error in case draggable and sortable are both true

right now the plan is to either use a DragZone OR a SortZone.

A combination of both would require a new implementation (a SortZone with an "optional" boundaryContainer, e.g. moving x px outside of the boundaryContainer => switch to the DragZone logic).
