# New guide: component.Base: promise bulkConfigUpdate

this new feature is incredibly powerful and deserves its own guide.

in short:
bulkConfigUpdate as a promise means:

1. lock a component for vdom updates
2. change all configs
3. trigger all afterSetConfig methods (which can change the vdom)
4. do 1 single post message from app => main => vdom worker
5. get the delta updates
6. vdom => main (apply the deltas to the real dom)
7. wait until they got applied
8. main => app (unlock the component) => resolve the promise
