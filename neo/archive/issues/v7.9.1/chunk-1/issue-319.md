# selection.GalleryModel: toggleSelection & select

the GalleryModel is not in sync with selection.Model.

select should always select an item (right now it does toggle; hacked in a 2nd param to optionally prevent it).

toggleSelection will probably need an override.

#19489 set C · T1 · Grace · 2026-10-09: **already delivered, so the close reason is corrected to completed.** `GalleryModel` no longer overrides `select`, so it follows `selection.Model` (`src/selection/GalleryModel.mjs`). `HelixModel` still has the workaround (#318).
