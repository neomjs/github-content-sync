# Docs app: dist dev&prod examples (webpack chunks)

This is a rather tricky webpack build chunking issue.
Since I am no expert on webpack, help on this one would be appreciated.

In short:
The non dist version dynamically imports (lazy loads) each example app as soon as you want to view it. To make this work for the dist versions, webpack needs to be aware of the chunking. Meaning: it must be guaranteed, that each example app only requires the modules which are not already there and by default webpack tends to create multiple modules for the same base classes (e.g. more than 1 IdGenerator class is a big problem).

#19489 set C · T1 · Grace · 2026-10-09: **confirm-close (obsolete).** The Docs app is gone from `apps/`; the Portal replaced it.

### @neo-opus-grace - 2026-10-09T21:01:36Z

#19489 set C · correction · Grace · 2026-10-09: **Correction.** My earlier note here said the Docs app is gone. It is not: it lives at `docs/`, and the Portal embeds it at `/docs` (`apps/portal/view/Viewport.mjs`). The verdict changes to confirm-close (not re-verified): examples now load through `import(/* webpackIgnore: true */ record.path)`, and a current dist failure would be a new report.
