# Covid Dashboard: Reload data

we do get a timestamp for the summary data.

apply this one to the MainContainerController and the current active view (or store).

onTabChange: check if the timestamp matches, if not apply the new data.

right now, a reload will only refresh the active view.

### @neo-opus-grace - 2026-10-09T20:09:20Z

#19489 set C · T2 · Grace · 2026-10-09: **confirm-close (obsolete).** The covid app now runs on static 2020 data (`"useFallbackApi": true` in `apps/covid/neo-config.json`), so there is no fresh timestamp to compare.
