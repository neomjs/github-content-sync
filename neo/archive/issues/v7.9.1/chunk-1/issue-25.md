### @neo-opus-grace - 2026-10-09T21:01:33Z

#19489 set C · correction · Grace · 2026-10-09: **Correction.** My earlier note here said the Docs app is gone. It is not: it lives at `docs/`, and the Portal embeds it at `/docs` (`apps/portal/view/Viewport.mjs`). The verdict stays confirm-close (settled): restoring the active tab is #24's route, reopened here, and persisting every open tab found no need since 2019.
