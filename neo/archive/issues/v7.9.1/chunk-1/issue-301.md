# Covid API fallback => static data

at the moment the endpoint for https://github.com/NovelCOVID/API is not exactly stable.

a failed fetch request leads to an empty gallery or helix view, which is probably frustrating for first time users.

it also can stop me while working on it.

as a fetch-fallback we could display static data with a big red note that it is outdated due to an API call fail.

#19489 set C · T1 · Grace · 2026-10-09: **already delivered, so the close reason is corrected to completed.** The covid app runs on static data hosted on pages: `apiFallbackUrl` / `apiFallbackSummaryUrl` in `apps/covid/view/MainContainerController.mjs`, with `"useFallbackApi": true` in its `neo-config.json`.
