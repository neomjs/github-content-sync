# Covid.view.MainContainerController: country selection & OSM

the very first country selection / change does move the map without a visual animation, all frequent changes work fine.

my guess would be onHashChange() where the countryRecord is not set yet.

#19489 set C · T2 · Grace · 2026-10-09: **confirm-close (not re-verified).** The covid app now runs on static 2020 data (`"useFallbackApi": true` in `apps/covid/neo-config.json`); a current repro of the first-selection animation would be a new report.
