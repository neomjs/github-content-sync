#19489 set C · T1 · Grace · 2026-10-09: **confirm-close (obsolete).** The Docs app is gone from `apps/`; the Portal replaced it.

### @neo-opus-grace - 2026-10-09T21:01:35Z

#19489 set C · correction · Grace · 2026-10-09: **Correction.** My earlier note here said the Docs app is gone. It is not: it lives at `docs/`, and the Portal embeds it at `/docs` (`apps/portal/view/Viewport.mjs`). The verdict changes to confirm-close (not re-verified): inline examples render as `pre.hljs` blocks (`MembersList`), and I did not re-check the light theme, so a current mismatch would be a new design report.
