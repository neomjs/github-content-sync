# Covid.view.HeaderContainer: Reload Button => add loading masks

clicking the loading button should add a loading mask & spinner on the currently active tab content.

after the API call is done and the store data is set, the mask needs to get removed again.

#19489 set C · T2 · Grace · 2026-10-09: **confirm-close (obsolete).** The covid app now runs on static 2020 data (`"useFallbackApi": true` in `apps/covid/neo-config.json`), so a reload has no API wait to mask.
