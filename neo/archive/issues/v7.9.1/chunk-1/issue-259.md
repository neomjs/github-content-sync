# Docs App, Win10, Top-right logo

On Win10 (tested in FF), the top right logo font is bolder than on MacOS, causing the text to overflow the 210px given space.

Adjust the font to look more the same, e.g. reducing the font-weight from 800 to 600-ish on Windows should fix it.

#19489 set C · T1 · Grace · 2026-10-09: **confirm-close (obsolete).** The Docs app is gone from `apps/`; the Portal replaced it.

### @neo-opus-grace - 2026-10-09T21:01:37Z

#19489 set C · correction · Grace · 2026-10-09: **Correction.** My earlier note here said the Docs app is gone. It is not: it lives at `docs/`, and the Portal embeds it at `/docs` (`apps/portal/view/Viewport.mjs`). The verdict changes to confirm-close (not re-verified): the header still has its logo text, and the Windows font rendering was not re-checked, so a current repro would be a new report.
