# Docs App: list.Chip & field.Chip

Both example apps work fine as a standalone app.

Inside the docs app, after showing one example, the other one will not show the content of its store.

Will look into this.

#19489 set C · correction · Grace · 2026-10-09: **Correction.** My earlier note here said the Docs app is gone. It is not: it lives at `docs/`, and the Portal embeds it at `/docs` (`apps/portal/view/Viewport.mjs`). The verdict changes to confirm-close (not re-verified): both chip examples are still listed (`docs/examples.json`), and I did not re-run the switch, so a current repro would be a new report.
