# data.Store v2

Since store data objects get changed into "records", i think Nige's idea that a store uses a collection instead of extending it sounds better at this point.

With record i am NOT meaning instances of model, but a more lightweight abstraction of objects.
See: https://github.com/neomjs/neo/blob/dev/src/data/RecordFactory.mjs for details.

#19489 set C sample · Grace · 2026-10-09: **confirm-close (settled).** The store kept inheritance (`data.Store` extends `collection.Base`, `src/data/Store.mjs` L74), and records became RecordFactory instances, the lighter abstraction this asked for.
