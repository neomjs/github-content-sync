# buildScripts/webpack/json/build.json => examples structure

the list-structure was sufficient when the project only had a few examples, but this is no longer the case.

it would be nice if we could use a nested examples structure, which matches the real folder & file structure.

to do this, we need to adjust `webpack.config.appworker.js` as well for the development and production mode.

it makes sense to move the `HtmlWebpackPlugin` generation into an own method.

deployment to github pages:
none of the example output files changed.

a perfect unit test.
