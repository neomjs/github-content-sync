# component.Base: isVdomUpdating change does not honor render

Hi Nige,

I am wondering about this change:
<img width="840" alt="Screenshot 2023-09-10 at 22 58 12" src="https://github.com/neomjs/neo/assets/1177434/fe173190-d488-433c-9a30-e7fa8f1f9826">

We also set this flag to true when calling `render()`. This is important, since updates which arrive while the initial rendering cycle is running need to get delayed.

If you want to keep:
```
    get isVdomUpdating() {
        // The VDOM is being updated if we have the promise that executeVdomUpdate uses
        return Boolean(this.vdomUpdate)
    }
```

we need to adjust all setters to modify `this.vdomUpdate` to a promise or null instead.

the alternative is to restore the old way how it worked.
