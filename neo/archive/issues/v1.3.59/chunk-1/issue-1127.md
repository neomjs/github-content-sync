# button.Split

We do need Split-Buttons for showing menues later on.

We need this markup in general:
```
<div>
    <button></button>
    <button></button>
</div>
```

We can still extend Button and just set the vdomRoot on the first button.

The second button-tag can extend button as well and get put into the new vdom structure.
