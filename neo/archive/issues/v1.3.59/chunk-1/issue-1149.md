# plugin.Resizable: add a mouse cursor rule to the doc body

the resize grab handle is very small. since the cursor is not sticky to the element while dragging, it jumps from cursor: pointer to the resize cursor back & forth.

on drag:start => add a resize cursor to the doc.body with !important and remove it on drag:end.
