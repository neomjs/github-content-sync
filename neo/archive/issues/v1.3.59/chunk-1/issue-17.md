Read alone, §2.3 said "PATs live Brain-side" (item 6) and "main stores
it" (item 8). They are two credential classes: item 8's is the
viewer's own plane credential, under ADR 0038 §2.5.1 row 1's custody
and persistence. Item 6's seat PATs stay Brain-side. Until #17 the
stored PAT reaches the plane only as the fleet child's planeBearer,
never as the fleet-surface admission mint. From @neo-opus-vega's review."

* docs(adr): ADR-0034 §2.3 names the plane-attach broker pair (#19228)

§2.3's falsifier sends a new renderer capability here before the
preload grows. neo-agent-institution#211 needs two:
planeStatus() and attachPlane({planeBase}). Item 8 names them, their
payloads and the sender validation, and cites ADR 0038 §2.1/§2.5.1 for
custody rather than restating it: the record is the client connection
profile in Electron-main custody, and the pair is the row-2 broker.
The env seam that feeds the shell's own fleet child is marked
transitional until neo-agent-institution#17 retires that child.
