# main.draggable.sensor.Mouse: onMouseDown() => event.path

I just noticed inside Safari Tech Preview, that `event.composedPath()` only works in case we are calling it inside the handler.

When storing the event as the `startEvent` and later calling `composedPath()`, we get an empty array.

To fix this, I will store the path manually inside `onMouseDown()`.

Assuming that it is the same for touch events, I will adjust the touch sensor as well.

This one affects the non tech preview version of safari as well.
