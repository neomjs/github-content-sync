# Portal.view.home.MainContainer: activePartsId

Let us store the currently intersecting child container and inside their activation logic then check, if it is still the visible item.

Rationale: if you scroll from the landing page over the helix to the colors app container, you do not want the helix container to switch to the `code.LivePreview` preview tab (lazy-loading & mounting the app).
