# plugin.Resizable: onDragStart() => initial proxy position

if i remember it right, `dialog.Base` had a wrapper node, which did get removed later on.

the resizable plugin is not honoring the change yet:
the proxy wrapper & content node can both get styles for height, left, top & width, leading to a wrong position.
