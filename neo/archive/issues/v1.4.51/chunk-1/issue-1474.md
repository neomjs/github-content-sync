# separate the webpack based split chunks into 1 folder for each thread

in some rare edge cases, webpack can create the same chunk file names for modules inside the main & app thread.

e.g.:

<img width="1212" alt="Screenshot 2020-12-03 at 22 29 58" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177434/101092046-51a63100-35b9-11eb-829c-65082f7a172b.png">

<img width="1275" alt="Screenshot 2020-12-03 at 22 31 39" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1177434/101092064-57037b80-35b9-11eb-9b0c-cad69dd4adcd.png">

294 will override the other version, resulting in a corrupted output for the prod env.

i will add folders like

chunks/app/*
chunks/main/*

to resolve this.
