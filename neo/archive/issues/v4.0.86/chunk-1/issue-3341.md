# buildThreads => main => broken for the non workspace based scope

The introduction of `workspace` based main thread addons seems to have one really bad side-effect which i missed.

While the dynamic imports are fine, webpack is not aware of being inside the framework scope or not, so it will try to parse a directory which simply does not exist.

Played around different strategies for a while and the only one I got working was (ab)using `webpack.ContextReplacementPlugin`.

@sokra: In case there is a cleaner way, feel free to add a comment. It might make sense to check for folders first within the webpack implementation and break in case the folder is not found.
