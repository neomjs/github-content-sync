# list.plugin.Animate: onStoreSort() => support for Neo.list.Component

`Neo.list.Component` is using index-based item ids to re-use component instances as much as possible.

However, this makes it tricky to apply an animated sorting. I will split the logic for list.Base and list.Component, to keep the algorithms reasonable.
