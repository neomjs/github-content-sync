# Neo.Main: editRoute()

remote method for the app worker.

setRoute() is already in place.

editRoute() needs one param => {Object} tokens

the window.location.hash needs to get tokenized (e.g. Neo.main.DomAccess: parseHash()) and all keys inside the tokens param need to get replaced while keeping all other existing ones.
