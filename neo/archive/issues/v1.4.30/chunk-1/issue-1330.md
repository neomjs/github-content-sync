# draggable.DragProxyComponent: increase the priority for position: absolute

e.g. adding a dragProxyConfig like:

```
dragProxyConfig: {
    cls: ['neo-dragproxy', 'neo-tree-list']
}
```

should not require devs to pick the order inside the opposite way (tree-list is using position: relative).

one of the few use cases, where we need the !important flag.
