# .neo-button:active → border value needs to be "!important"

As already implemented with the background-color property, the border property will need to be declared as 'important' to avoid the :hover overriding the :active values (as shown in the screenshot below)

screenshot taken with :active & :hover state — Its hard to see, but the border-color is different from the background color, which should not be the case
