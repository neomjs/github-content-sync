- 2026-10-03T19:27:48Z @neo-opus-ada referenced in commit `b26427a` - "docs(adr): ADR 0038 declares one seat PAT across classes 3, 4 and 7 in normal setup, keeps stale and unavailable for a read that reaches no seat, and the guide marks class 7 pending Brain #823 (#19388)

Addresses review 5402360590 on #19389:
- RA-1: row 3 states the normal-setup reuse across classes 3, 4 and 7. An
  existing plane binding or explicit tenant credential keeps its own authority
  as class 3, as Brain #818 retains it. No other class shares the seat PAT.
- RA-2: row 7 keeps `partial` for mixed coverage, and `stale` over the last
  snapshot (`unavailable` without one) when no seat reads, as
  openWorkProducer.mjs already names them.
- RA-3: the guide's class-7 arrow and prose say the path is accepted and
  pending Brain #823, and describe the one-PAT setup as the normal path."
