i upgraded to v0.51.0, and was missing that the setup changed.

the breaking change was not mentioned inside the release notes:
https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor/releases/tag/v0.51.0

i found it here:

tried it out with removing the file, and it is causing serious damage:

i will switch back to the previous version and create a bug ticket for microsoft.

## Resumed compatibility repair — operator-directed, 2026-09-05

The original `0.51.0` migration is still relevant: the operator reports a blank `apps/portal` after the grouped dependency update moved Monaco from exact `0.50.0` to exact `0.56.0` (commit `c691107353`, PR #18325), while both integration classes stayed unchanged. The original comment's warning that deleting the NLS script alone is insufficient remains a useful negative control.

**Intake:** valid as the existing compatibility lane, with the operator's current request covering the main-thread addon, wrapper APIs, and missing browser coverage. Ticket created 2024-08-26, updated 2026-05-16, `no auto close`; current source and package bytes, not its age, validate the work. No competing Monaco implementation surfaced in live PR/A2A sweeps. No ADR mutation or new runtime subsystem.

The `0.56.0` package lacks `editor/editor.main.nls.js`; its `editor.main.js` is now a small named AMD entry whose dependencies/factory install the stylesheet, workers and global editor API. Neo currently injects that file as a raw script and never awaits AMD module resolution. The actual portal MIME/rejection failure will be recorded before the repair.

| Surface | Authority | Intended change | Failure behavior | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `main.addon.MonacoEditor#loadFiles` | shipped Monaco AMD entry | load the AMD loader and await `vs/editor/editor.main`, allowing its own NLS/CSS/worker setup | reject with an actionable load error | real installed-package browser boot; no fake global `monaco` |
| addon editor operations | Monaco public editor/model APIs | validate language, theme, model value, options, resize and disposal; replace private/removed access where necessary | safe missing/retired editor handling | browser operations against the real editor |
| wrapper lifecycle | `core.Base` async ownership and `component.Base` mount/window lifecycle | prevent retired mounts from creating editors; release native editor/model/listener ownership | late work cannot revive a destroyed or moved holder | mount/change/destroy/recreate controls |
| exact dependency pin | operator's deliberate compatibility boundary | retain an exact Monaco version; prevent it riding inside the broad version-update group | future integration change stays explicit | Dependabot configuration and a browser job that runs on dependency changes |
| CI coverage | existing component suite runs on dependency edits | exercise portal boot plus the Monaco wrapper under Chromium | missing assets and rejected initialization fail CI | red on old integration, green on repair |

Acceptance for this resumed work:
1. Portal boot completes with Monaco `0.56.0`; the installed assets return the proper content types and no Monaco initialization failure remains.
2. The real editor renders and supports value editing, runtime language/theme/options changes and its worker-backed language path.
3. Destroy/recreate and retired mount/window-generation controls leave no duplicate live editor/model and no late recreation.
4. CI browser coverage reaches the production addon and wrapper with the installed Monaco package; the broken loader is a discriminating red control.
5. Monaco remains exact-pinned and isolated from bulk version bumps. No DOMPurify security closure is claimed: #18354 owns the bundled-sanitizer issue.

Picking up on the operator's current direction; previous assignee @tobiu, last recorded issue implementation comment 2024-08-26T18:44:54Z. I will preserve the original issue body and its rollback evidence.

**`[lane-override]` reassignment audit-trail** (#11537 §AC8)

**Previous assignees:** `@tobiu`
**New assignees:** `neo-gpt`
**Reason:** Operator requested the Monaco addon/wrapper compatibility repair in this session; resuming the existing ticket rather than creating a duplicate. Original operator body and rollback comment preserved.

*Audit-trail per AGENTS.md §6.5 — `acknowledgedReassign` reason persistence. Graph-ingested via Retrospective daemon comment-scan path.*
