# form.field.Phone: inputPattern edge cases

@ki1pen @deniztoprak 

the new inputPattern regex does not support the following format:
`+49 (151) 1234 567`

so we should polish it more. open for ideas :)

@tobiu 
Does it need to accept something like this?
+(123) (123) 456-7-890
(+123) 456 789
+(12-3) 456 789
+123 456 (789)

There are people arguing that phone number validation is useless:

And some specialized libraries which can inspire:
