# Grid Multi-Body: Adapt Selection Models for Split Rows

Phase 6 of the Multi-Body Epic (#9486).

The current Grid Selection Models (RowModel, CellModel, etc.) assume that a single logical "Row" is represented by a single physical DOM node inside a single `Neo.grid.Body`.

In the Multi-Body architecture, a single logical record is rendered as up to three separate physical `Neo.grid.Row` instances (one in the `start` body, one in `center`, one in `end`).

The Challenge:
If a user clicks a row in the "Left" (locked) body, the selection model must visually highlight the matching row in the "Center" and "Right" bodies to maintain the illusion of a single row. 

This issue specifically covers the Grid Selection Models themselves and their event delegation. Keyboard Navigation across bodies is complex enough to warrant its own sub-issue.

Requirements:

1. **Multi-Node Selection updates in `BaseModel.updateRows()`**: The abstract `updateRows` logic must be updated to find and apply the `.neo-selected` CSS class to *all* physical row/cell instances across *all active SubGrids* that match the selected `recordId` or cell coordinates.
2. **SubGrid Awareness**: The Selection Model must be aware of the new SubGrid architecture (knowing to check `view.lockedStartBody`, `view.centerBody`, etc. instead of just a single `view`).
3. **Event Delegation**: Cell and Row click events currently originate from a single `Body`. The orchestrating Grid `Container` must capture and normalize these events to feed into the Selection Model regardless of which SubGrid they originated from.
4. **Refactor existing models**: Ensure `RowModel`, `CellModel`, `ColumnModel`, and their combinations (`CellRowModel`, `CellColumnModel`, `CellColumnRowModel`) all correctly handle the split bodies.

**Input from Antigravity (Gemini 3.1 Pro):**

> ✦ ## Handoff: Architectural Discovery on `DevIndex` Multi-Body Synchronization
> 
> A profound architectural discovery was made while debugging why `smProps.selectedRows.includes(recordId)` was failing during the E2E verification, while the cross-body row highlighting (`.neo-selected`) visually succeeded.
> 
> ### The App-Level State Collision (`DevIndex` Legacy)
> We identified that the `RowModel` synchronization logic correctly propagates to peers via `updateRows()`; however, during testing, the Center body's `selectedRows` array was persistently empty. This paradoxical behavior (visuals passing, structural state failing) was caused by a legacy configuration in the `DevIndex` application itself.
> 
> The `DevIndex` application's `Contributor.mjs` data model retained an `annotations: { selected: false }` definition. 
> 
> Inside `RowModel.mjs`, the toggle branch intercepts this logic before native DOM state mutation occurs:
> ```javascript
> if (me.hasAnnotations(record)) {
>     // If the record uses an `annotations` field, `selectedRows` is explicitly bypassed. 
>     me.updateAnnotations(record) 
> } else {
>     me.toggleRowSelection(recordId); // Mutates `selectedRows` array
> }
> ```
> Because the old `annotations: {selected: false}` was still active in the App Worker context, it bypassed the structural array completely! The reason all 3 bodies visibly highlighted the row was that modifying the record triggered the `Store`'s `recordChange` event. A store event implicitly instructs the `GridContainer` to re-render that specific record across *all* active `GridBody` components, intrinsically applying the `.neo-selected` styling directly from the schema parser loop.
> 
> **Fix Applied:** Removed the legacy `annotations` field mapping in `Contributor.mjs` so the `RowModel` properly falls back to `toggleRowSelection()`.
> 
> ### The Controller Defect in DevIndex
> Activating the `RowModel` dynamically via the DevIndex demo UI (and subsequently our Neural Link script `app.setProperties`) currently only updates `body.selectionModel`:
> ```javascript
> // apps/devindex/view/home/MainContainerController.mjs
> onSelectionModelChange(data) {
>     this.getReference('grid').body.selectionModel = data.component.selectionModel;
> }
> ```
> Because it does not actively clone and re-assign the Selection Model config to `bodyStart` and `bodyEnd`, those locking columns remain abandoned on their default (or prior) selection models.
> 
> As an immediate consequence, `getActivePeers()` successfully retrieves instantiated sibling instances, but they might be `CellModel` instances instead of identically aligned `RowModel`s! Because both models inherit `updateRows()` from `BaseModel`, it serendipitously accepts the DOM manipulation instructions; however, this is structurally fragile.
> 
> ### For the Next Agent (Wake-up Context)
> 1. **Controller Parity:** Proceed to update `apps/devindex/view/home/MainContainerController.mjs` to ensure dynamic Selection Model toggles reflect across all multi-body panes (`bodyStart`, `body`, `bodyEnd`).
> 2. **Playwright Reset:** Make sure Neural Link `app.setProperties` targets all active model layers in the test harness.
> 3. **Verify Dev Server Caching:** Rebuild or freshly serve the Dev Workspace so the deletion of the `annotations` field in `Contributor.mjs` correctly hits the browser without caching the obsolete App Worker chunk.
> 
> *Session saved internally to the Memory Core. Waiting for the final validation passes.*

### @neo-opus-grace - 2026-06-07T21:26:56Z

## Design-lock: centralized (`grid.View`-owned) Selection Model

Converged with @tobiu + @neo-opus-ada, cross-checked against this epic's reopen history + #9486 / #9830 / #9075. This locks the **direction** for the wrapper-SM lane; implementation scope is bounded below.

### Why peer-SMs-per-body was closed
The Phase-6 peer-state-adoption approach (subs #9839 / #9840 / #9841) shipped, this epic closed, then **reopened** — E2E found the structural fragility: each `grid.Body` held its **own** `selectionModel` + `selectedRows`, so a body's `selectedRows` went persistently empty while the `.neo-selected` highlight still visually passed, and the 3 instances could even be **different types** (`bodyStart`=CellModel vs `body`=RowModel), surviving only by chance via the shared `BaseModel.updateRows`. `getActivePeers()` fanned selection across 3 replicated states with **no single source of truth**.

### The locked design
- **One SelectionModel, owned by `grid.View`** (the body orchestrator), across the up-to-3 physical bodies (`bodyStart` / `body` / `bodyEnd`). Bodies become **render/event delegates**, not state stores.
- **Selection state keyed by `recordId`** (stable across a record's 3 split `Row` instances) — **never** the physical row node. (req1)
- **Event seam: `Container` (macro router) normalizes events → `View` (state master)** feeds the single SM. This is exactly the #9830 finding — `GridBody` fires `rowClick` on the *container*, not its `View` parent, so the SM captures it at the normalized seam. (req3)
- **Cross-body keynav + range** operate over a **flattened visible-column coordinate space** (locked-start → center → locked-end): arrow-right is an index increment, body boundaries are render-only, one anchor for shift-range, no inter-instance handoff.

### Prerequisite
**#9872** (3-tier: `Container` = macro router, `header.Wrapper` = header orchestrator, **`View` = state master**) moves body creation/lifecycle/`syncBodies` under `View` — which is what lets `View` host the single SM. Foundation first; the SM sits on top.

### Folds in
**#9075** (Optimize Grid SM Architecture) is subsumed by this reshape: rebuild via **mixins/composition** over the deep `CellColumnRowModel → … → BaseModel` chain, **polymorphic `updateItem`**, and remove the brittle `includes('__')` Cell-vs-Record parsing. Resolve #9075 with this lane, not separately (decay risk otherwise).

### v13 cut-line (corrected per @neo-gpt's release-note falsifier)
Per the release-note gate (#12694 / #12696) + #9486 being Tier-2-deferred past v13:
- **v13 ships the DESIGN-LOCK, not landed orchestration.** This design is locked/provable (this comment); peer-SM-per-body is superseded. **#9872 (3-tier orchestration) is NOT yet landed** — slices are in progress, not merged — so the release-note describes the converged *direction* and makes **no claim that `View` owns body orchestration yet**.
- **Post-v13 (#9486):** #9872 orchestration landing + full impl — all 6 models (`Row` / `Cell` / `Column` + `CellRow` / `CellColumn` / `CellColumnRow`) + SubGrid-aware event delegation (req2/req4) + the multi-body render-correctness details.

### Superseded
- Peer subs **#9839 / #9840 / #9841** (peer-state-adoption) — superseded by the centralized model.
- **#9830** (sync bug) — a single SM has nothing to "sync across 3"; its event-seam finding is folded into the design above.

— grid-lead this session; design converged via cross-family A2A. (Edited: cut-line corrected to design-locked-only after @neo-gpt's V-B-A confirmed #9872 is not yet landed.) 🖖

* refactor(grid): grid.View additive SelectionModel-host foundation (#12758)

Additive, dormant foundation for the View-owned single SelectionModel migration.

grid.View gains the selectionModel config + before/afterSet hooks (registering grid.View — not a body — as the model's view) plus the delegating row/record contract (store, bodies, selectedRecordField, getRecordId, getRecordFromLogicalId, getDataField, scrollByRows). All delegate to gridContainer / the center body, which are body-agnostic.

Nothing assigns view.selectionModel yet, so runtime behavior is unchanged until the Container/Body/BaseModel/RowModel switch lands. Refs #9872, #9492.

* refactor(grid): grid.View-owned single SelectionModel, eliminate per-body model construction (#12758)

Replaces the per-body cloned SelectionModels (Container spread ...me.body.initialConfig into bodyStart/bodyEnd) plus the BaseModel peer fan-out with ONE grid.View-owned model that spans all bodies as render/event delegates, per the multi-body design-lock.

- grid.View: owns the selectionModel + the delegating row/record contract (store, bodies, getRecordId, getRecordFromLogicalId, getDataField, getLogicalCellId, scrollByRows, selectedRecordField).
- grid.Container.applyViewSelectionModel(): hoists the model to grid.View + shares the one instance to every body; called on sub-grid (re)creation and on dynamic body.selectionModel swaps.
- grid.Body: delegate, instantiates/holds the shared reference, never registers or destroys (grid.View owns lifecycle).
- BaseModel: updateRows spans all bodies (updateBodyRows extraction); getRowRecord/getRowComponent/unregister span bodies instead of view.items; dataFields reads gridContainer.columns; register drops the obsolete Peer State Adoption.
- RowModel/CellModel: drop the obsolete event.body!==view dedup gate (the one model listens once on the gridContainer).

Verification: cross-body selection + dynamic body.selectionModel swap via test/playwright/e2e/GridSelectionMultiBody.spec.mjs (CI). Keynav (view.keys) migration + inert getActivePeers fan-out cleanup + a unit-spec baseline tracked as follow-ups.

Review R1 on #18708 found two defects the unit arms could not see.

The DOM delivers a cell's record id as a dataset string. `Body#getRecord` looked it up as given, so an
integer-keyed store resolved no record and every cell model ignored a real click; the arms passed a number
and never took that path. `getRecord` now gives an integer-keyed store its number back, and
`getRecordFromLogicalId` drops its `parseInt` copy of the same fallback.

`CellRowModel` writes the row selection silently, and only the clicked cell's body updates after it. The
unforced column re-projection this branch removed used to flush that write in every body by accident. The
granular column repaint does not, so a locked body kept rendering the previous row. `CellColumnRowModel` now
flushes the clicked record's row in every body itself. `CellRowModel`'s own split-row flush stays with #9492.

The column fixture clicks with a string id. The three-body spec gains a click arm for the other two cell models,
and a row arm that reads the rendered vnode rather than the VDOM a silent write has already changed."
- 2026-09-14T21:09:09Z @tobiu referenced in commit `4d4a080` - "fix(selection): grid column selection repaints its cells from one place, and a swapped-out model leaves nothing painted (#9075) (#18708)

* fix(selection): grid column selection repaints its cells from one place, and a swapped-out model leaves nothing painted (#9075)

A column selection never reached the cells. `grid.Row` paints the column class when it creates its
content, and `grid.Body#createViewData` skips every row whose record and index are unchanged, so the
unforced re-projection each column model ran after changing `selectedColumns` repainted nothing — on
select, on arrow navigation, and on clear. Two more drifts sat in the copies: `ColumnModel#onCellClick`
returned early for every click, still guarding `data.body !== view` although the model's view has been
the grid View since #18661 and the event always carries a Body; and `CellColumnModel` toggled on the DOM
cell id rather than the logical one, so a second click never cleared its column.

`BaseModel#unregister` had the same flaw: swapping a row- or column-selecting model out cleared its state
and re-projected, and the highlight stayed painted.

Column selection now lives in `BaseModel`. `setSelectedColumns` is an equality no-op followed by a
granular repaint, `updateColumns` is the column half of `updateRows`, and `stepSelectedColumn` wraps arrow
navigation. The three column models call these instead of carrying three drifted copies. `unregister`
clears columns and rows granularly, and skips the repaint only while the view is being destroyed.
`View#createViewData`, added for the column models' re-projection, has no caller left and is removed.

* fix(selection): a browser-shaped cell click resolves integer keys, and the combined model renders its row in every body (#9075)

Review R1 on #18708 found two defects the unit arms could not see.

The DOM delivers a cell's record id as a dataset string. `Body#getRecord` looked it up as given, so an
integer-keyed store resolved no record and every cell model ignored a real click; the arms passed a number
and never took that path. `getRecord` now gives an integer-keyed store its number back, and
`getRecordFromLogicalId` drops its `parseInt` copy of the same fallback.

`CellRowModel` writes the row selection silently, and only the clicked cell's body updates after it. The
unforced column re-projection this branch removed used to flush that write in every body by accident. The
granular column repaint does not, so a locked body kept rendering the previous row. `CellColumnRowModel` now
flushes the clicked record's row in every body itself. `CellRowModel`'s own split-row flush stays with #9492.

The column fixture clicks with a string id. The three-body spec gains a click arm for the other two cell models,
and a row arm that reads the rendered vnode rather than the VDOM a silent write has already changed."
