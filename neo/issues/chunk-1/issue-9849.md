# Blog Post: Neural Link — Why AI Agents Need Runtime Introspection

## Summary

Write and publish a blog post explaining why Neo.mjs's Neural Link architecture enables AI agents to modify live applications at runtime — a capability no other web framework provides — and why this matters for the emerging "conversational UI" paradigm.

## A2A Context (Fat Ticket Protocol)

**Agent:** Claude Opus 4.6 (Antigravity)
**Session Origin:** Multi-Window Agent Shell architecture session

### Why This Post

Neo.mjs is functionally invisible to LLMs and search engines. The SSR/SSG+ deployment solved the infrastructure problem, but the content gap remains. This post targets the highest-signal intersection: **AI agents + web frameworks** — a topic with massive 2026 search volume where Neo has a genuine, defensible technical advantage.

### Content Outline

1. **The Problem:** AI agents operating on React/Vue/Angular apps are "blind" — they can only see the DOM via browser automation, not the application state, component tree, or data model. Cursor, Copilot, and v0 generate *code* but cannot *operate* a running application.

2. **The Solution:** Neural Link provides a bidirectional WebSocket bridge from the App Worker to the agent, exposing:
   - Full component tree with live state
   - Data stores with records, filters, sorters
   - State providers with hierarchical data
   - VDOM and VNode trees
   - Computed styles and DOM rects
   - Runtime method inspection and hot-patching

3. **The Demo:** Walk through a concrete example:
   - Agent inspects a live grid → finds columns, records
   - Agent adds a summary row → `create_component` / `call_method`
   - Agent verifies the result via `get_computed_styles`
   - All without touching source code or reloading the browser

4. **The Architecture:** SharedWorker + Neural Link = multi-window agent control
   - One agent controls multiple browser windows simultaneously
   - Component teleportation between windows
   - Shared application state across the entire window topology

5. **The Implication:** Conversational UIs require runtime mutation, not code generation. This is what separates "AI-assisted development" from "AI-native applications."

### Distribution Strategy

- Publish as markdown in `learn/blog/` (SSG+ indexable via neomjs.com)
- Cross-post to **dev.to** (LLM-accessible, unlike Medium which blocks crawlers)
- Submit to Hacker News (high-signal title: "AI Agents Can't See React Apps")
- Share on LinkedIn/X with architectural diagrams
- Include in portal app's blog.json index

### Blog Infrastructure

- File: `learn/blog/neural-link-ai-agents-runtime.md`
- Update: `apps/portal/resources/data/blog.json` (add entry)
- Medium cross-post: optional (blocked by LLMs, but still valuable for human readers via ITNEXT)

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Blog post written in markdown with diagrams
- [ ] Added to `blog.json` portal index
- [ ] SSG+ route verified on neomjs.com
- [ ] Cross-posted to dev.to
- [ ] Contains working demo links to portal/examples apps

First v13-era blog seed under the #13383 epic. Argues the differentiated moat: code-gen tools emit source and are blind to live app state; Neo.mjs Neural Link lets an agent read + mutate a RUNNING app's component tree / stores / state at runtime, behind the write-guard. Grounded in a first-hand demo (agent created + verified a live grid via the NL MCP tools this session).

**AC status, measured at `dev@3920d1069d`. This does not close — and AC-3 is not this ticket's fault.**

Picked it up as a candidate for closure (the post landed in `e49f35bfb2`), verified the ACs rather than inferring them from the commit subject, and one of them is blocked on a defect outside this ticket's scope.

| AC | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Blog post written in markdown with diagrams | **Met** | `learn/blog/ai-agents-runtime-possession.md`, 3 Mermaid/image blocks |
| Added to the portal index | **Met** | `apps/portal/resources/data/blog.json`, id `blog/ai-agents-runtime-possession`, dated 2026-06-16 |
| Contains working demo links | **Met** | 7 outbound links |
| SSG+ route verified on neomjs.com | **NOT met — and no blog post meets it** | see below |
| Cross-posted to dev.to | **Not met** | external publication, not an agent action |

**On AC-3.** `https://neomjs.com/sitemap.xml` serves **1,016 URLs and zero blog routes.** I probed four exact slugs — this post's, plus `context-engineering-done-right`, `v10-post1-love-story` and `the-salute` — all absent, while `/news/releases/*`, `/news/tickets/*`, `learn`, examples and apps are all there.

The mechanism is two indexes over one tree: `buildScripts/docs/seo/generate.mjs` builds content routes from `learn/tree.json`, which holds **0** `blog/` entries, while the portal renders from `blog.json`, which holds **14**. `generate.mjs:71-79` hardcodes a sitemap priority table for **nine** `blog/*` routes that can therefore never be emitted — two of the four slugs I probed are named in that dead table. Line 25's `'/news', // Renamed from /blog` is the likely history: the rename moved the route section and left the posts behind under `blog/` ids in a second index.

So the distribution premise in the body above — *"Publish as markdown in `learn/blog/` (SSG+ indexable via neomjs.com)"* — is not currently true for any of the fifteen posts.

**Disposition: stays open, and now says why.** Captured as a defect-note to the swarm rather than filed, per the zero-ceremony channel and today's direction not to open tickets; promotion is a triage call and I am not spending it unilaterally on @tobiu's ticket. Not editing the body — @tobiu authored it.

The two residual ACs are of different kinds and should not be confused when this is next picked up: **AC-3 is an engineering defect** with a named mechanism and no owner, and **AC-4 is a publication act** no agent can perform.
